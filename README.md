A Chrome Extension for right-click searching an artist's upcoming tour dates quickly and simply.

Built during August 2017 Songkick Hackday ‚õè

Originally generated using `react-chrome-extension-boilerplate`.

# Commands

`yarn dev` to spin up a dev environment.

# Future Work

* **Actually write some unit tests!** (It *was* a hackday project)
* Store state in Redux rather than component state
* Use SK oAuth so allow a user to login and track directly from the extension
* Add additional artist stuff; Spotify player, etc.
